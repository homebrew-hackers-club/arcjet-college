## ü§ñ Overview

Arcjet helps you manage automated traffic (bots) so the right requests reach your app. You can allow good bots (e.g., search crawlers) and deny unwanted ones (e.g., scrapers), with simple, composable rules. See concepts and capabilities in the official docs [Concepts](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/concepts) and [Identifying bots](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/identifying-bots).

## üß≠ Why configure bot protection?

- **Good vs bad bots**: Some bots index your site or monitor uptime; others scrape content or abuse forms.
- **robots.txt is not enough**: Not all bots respect it.
- **Granular control**: Allow bots for APIs but deny them for sensitive flows like signup forms.

## üß† Bot detection realities

- **No solution blocks 100% of bad bots.** Sophisticated bots mimic real users.
- **Plans with IP analysis**: Starter/Business plans add IP-based verification to catch imposters (e.g., pretending to be Google).
- **Combine with rate limiting**: Best results come from layering bot protection with rate limits.
- **Trade-offs exist**: Fingerprint-based blocking may temporarily affect some legitimate users behind shared IPs.

## üîç Identifying and configuring bots

You can explicitly allow or deny individual bots, and/or entire categories. In TypeScript, identifiers autocomplete to make configuration easy.

### Allow specific known bots

```ts
// Block all bots except specific Google/Bing crawlers and curl
detectBot({
  mode: "LIVE", // use "DRY_RUN" to observe first
  allow: [
    "GOOGLE_CRAWLER",
    "GOOGLE_CRAWLER_NEWS",
    "BING_CRAWLER",
    "CURL",
  ],
});
```

### Allow categories (plus optional individuals)

Available categories include: `CATEGORY:SEARCH_ENGINE`, `CATEGORY:PROGRAMMATIC`, `CATEGORY:PREVIEW`, `CATEGORY:AI`, `CATEGORY:MONITOR`, `CATEGORY:FEEDFETCHER`, `CATEGORY:GOOGLE`, `CATEGORY:MICROSOFT`, `CATEGORY:META`, `CATEGORY:TOOL`, `CATEGORY:VERCEL`, `CATEGORY:YAHOO`, `CATEGORY:ARCHIVE`, `CATEGORY:OPTIMIZER`, `CATEGORY:ACADEMIC`, `CATEGORY:SOCIAL`, `CATEGORY:AMAZON`, `CATEGORY:UNKNOWN`.

```ts
// Block all bots except search engines and curl
detectBot({
  mode: "LIVE",
  allow: [
    "CATEGORY:SEARCH_ENGINE", // Google, Bing, etc
    "CURL", // allow a specific bot alongside a category
  ],
});
```

Note: Only configured categories are checked for performance. Worst-case comparison is roughly `count(detectedBot) * count(configuredCategories)`.

## üßæ Handling missing User-Agent headers

Requests without a `User-Agent` cannot be reliably matched to a bot and are marked as errored. Most legitimate clients include it (per RFC 7231 guidance). You can choose to block requests missing a `User-Agent` with a filter rule:

```ts
filter({
  // Deny any traffic with no user-agent header
  deny: ['len(http.request.headers["user-agent"]) eq 0'],
  mode: "LIVE", // use DRY_RUN to log only first
});
```

Alternatively, check results after a decision using `@arcjet/inspect`:

```ts
import { isMissingUserAgent } from "@arcjet/inspect";

if (decision.results.some(isMissingUserAgent)) {
  // e.g., log or return a 400 Bad Request
  // Next.js: return NextResponse.json({ error: "Bad request" }, { status: 400 });
  // Node.js: res.writeHead(400, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
  //          res.end(JSON.stringify({ error: "Bad request" }));
}
```

## üß™ Custom bots and filters

If a bot isn‚Äôt in the known list, block it using a custom filter (e.g., by header pattern, path, or behavior). See the Malicious traffic blueprint in the docs for examples.

## üß± Blocking based on fingerprint

When Arcjet detects bot activity, it may block further requests using a client fingerprint (including IP). This can inadvertently affect some legitimate users behind the same IP for a period, but improves overall safety against abusive traffic.

## ‚úÖ Practical recommendations

- **Start in DRY_RUN** to observe impact before enforcing.
- **Layer with rate limiting** for defense-in-depth and fewer false positives.
- **Allow good bots** you rely on (search, monitors); deny the rest.
- **Handle missing User-Agent** with a filter or post-decision check.
- **Monitor and iterate**; bot ecosystems evolve, and so should rules.
